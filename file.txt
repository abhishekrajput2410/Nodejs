Roses are red,
Violets are blue,
I tried to debug,
Now nothing's new.

My code was broken,
Stack overflow's spoken,
I added more logs,
And woke up some frogs.

Console.log said,
"undefined," it read,
I cried and I screamed,
Then woke from my dream.

The bug was in me,
Not the machinery,
Coffee helped out,
No longer in doubt!
